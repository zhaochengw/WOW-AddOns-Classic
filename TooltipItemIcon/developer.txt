TooltipItemIcon provides two functions for use by other AddOns:


*** TooltipItemIcon_DisplayIcon

* TooltipItemIcon_DisplayIcon (frame [,link [,location [,compare]]])
frame = reference to your tooltip frame
link = string containing the link code for the item, or nil
location = string containing one of TooltipItemIcon's location codes (see below), or nil
compare = true if you consider your frame to be a 'compare' tooltip, nil otherwise

This attaches the relevant icon to your frame.
It needs to be called each time the link changes.
If TooltipItemIcon cannot find an icon for your link (or the link is nil), the icon will be hidden.
Whenever your frame becomes hidden, the attached icon will also be hidden.

The location and compare codes will be remembered for your frame - you need only include them the first time you call this function for each frame (they are ignored after the first time).


*** TooltipItemIcon_HookFrame

* TooltipItemIcon_HookFrame (frame [,location [,compare]])
frame = reference to your tooltip frame
location = string containing one of TooltipItemIcon's location codes (see below), or nil
compare = true if you consider your frame to be a 'compare' tooltip, nil otherwise

This function sets up hooks which will attempt to display an icon for whatever link your tooltip is currently displaying


*** location codes
Normally TooltipItemIcon attaches a small extra frame to the side of the tooltip. The location code tells TooltipItemIcon the default location to attach this frame. (Note that the user can override the default).
lefttop: on the left, near the top
righttop: on the right, near the top
topleft: on top, at the left hand side
topright: on top, at the right hand side
topcenter: on top, in the middle (note the spelling of 'center')
bottomleft: at the bottom, on the left hand side
bottomright: at the bottom, on the right hand side
bottomcenter: at the bottom, in the middle
if no location is provided, TooltipItemIcon defaults to "lefttop"
