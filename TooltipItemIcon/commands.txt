*** Tooltip Commands

/ttii <tooltip name> <location code>
(Frame mode only)
Moves the icon frame to a new location around the specified tooltip, for example at the top right or at the bottom. The new location is saved for that tooltip.

<tooltip name> may be either the exact name of the tooltip or a 'template name'. A template name can be used to change multiple tooltips at the same time. This only works for a set of tooltips that have the same basic name but end in a different number, e.g. shoppingtooltip1 and shoppingtooltip2.
A template name consists of all the characters before the number, in this case shoppingtooltip

Common tooltip names:
gametooltip: the default popup tooltip that appears when you mouse over something
itemreftooltip: the default tooltip that appears when you click on a link in chat
shoppingtooltip1, shoppingtooltip2, shoppingtooltip3: the default 'comparison' tooltips

<location code> must be one of the following codes:
lefttop: on the left, near the top
righttop: on the right, near the top
topleft: on top, at the left hand side
topright: on top, at the right hand side
topcenter: on top, in the middle (note the spelling of 'center')
bottomleft: at the bottom, on the left hand side
bottomright: at the bottom, on the right hand side
bottomcenter: at the bottom, in the middle
default: clears any previously saved location for this tooltip

/ttii all <location code>
(Frame mode only)
Applies the <location code> to all known tooltips

/ttii screen <location code>
(Frame mode only)
Applies the <location code> to all tooltips currently visible on screen

/ttii compare <location code>
(Frame mode only)
Applies the <location code> to all known compare-type tooltips


/ttii <tooltip name> <action>
/ttii all <action>
/ttii screen <action>
(All modes)

<action> is one of:

off : Disable the icon for the specified tooltip(s). This setting is saved for each tooltip. Immediately hides the icon.

on : Enable the icon for the specified tooltip(s). Removes the 'off' setting from the saved settings. Icon will be shown when the tooltip is next opened.

reset : Clear all saved settings for the specified tooltip(s), including on/off setting and location setting.


/ttii compare reset
Works as above for all known compare tooltips

/ttii compare on|off
Enable or disable icons on all compare-style tooltips. This setting is saved Globally (not for each tooltip).
