TooltipItemIcon

Adds icons to your tooltips.

Displays icons for Items, Spells and many other things.

Frame mode adds the icon as a small extra frame attached to the side of the tooltip. The icon frame can be moved to different locations around the tooltip.

Inside mode adds the icon inside the tooltip, in the top right corner.

Title mode adds the icon inside the tooltip, in the top left corner. (This mode may cause compatibility issues with a few other AddOns, in which case try another mode.)

Background mode uses the icon as a background for the tooltip.

Some people dislike having icons on the tooltip that pops up when you hold your mouse over an item (GameTooltip), and the comparison tooltips that appear when you hold your mouse over an item in a shop (ShoppingTooltip1 & 2). You can fix this by typing the following commands into your chat edit box:

/ttii gametooltip off
/ttii shoppingtooltip off

The following command will turn off icons for all comparison-type tooltips supported by TooltipItemIcon:

/ttii compare off

Additionally you can turn off the icons for some of the different types of tooltip using one or more of the following commands:

/ttii item off
/ttii spell off
/ttii achievement off
