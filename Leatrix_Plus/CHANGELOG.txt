2.5.83 - 9th January 2022
- The 'Show flight times' option ('Interface') now supports multiple flight routes to the same destination.  So it will work regardless of how many flight points you have unlocked.  Due to the code changes to include multiple routes, some of the submitted flight times could not be added.  Please report them again when you see the report window again.

2.5.82 - 5th January 2022
- The 'Show flight times' option ('Interface') now works with any locale without the need for translations.  Added lots of missing flight times.  After landing from a flight, if the saved flight time is missing or incorrect (greater than 5 second difference), you will see a copy-friendly window with the flight details making it very easy for you to report the missing or incorrect flight time.

2.5.81 - 29th December 2021
- You need to restart your game client after installing this update.
- Added a new setting 'Show flight times' ('Interface').  If enabled, a flight time progress bar will be shown when you take a flight and travel times will be shown in the flight point tooltips (note: only for flight times that Leatrix Plus is aware of).  For the time being, all flight times (whether known or not) will be printed in chat when you land so that you can report inaccurate or missing flight times (there are some of both).  If a flight ends before or after the progress bar has reached zero, report the flight time printed in chat and the times will be updated.  You can report at github.com/leatrix or you can send a message to leatrix on CurseForge.  If you're using the 'Recent chat window' setting ('Chat'), you can use that to copy the text from chat for your report.  For non-English locales, the progress bar and flight times will only be shown if the start and end flight point names have been translated.  If you want to help with translations to solve that issue, send a message to leatrix on CurseForge.

2.5.80 - 22nd December 2021
- If 'Combine addon buttons' ('Enhance minimap)' is enabled, addon button tooltips will no longer show together with game tooltips.  Non-standard buttons are now always replaced with LibDBIcon buttons so the 'Replace non-standard buttons' setting has been removed.  In addition, non-standard buttons will (for now) be described as such in the button tooltips.  You can now set the cluster scale again (note that adjusting the cluster scale has side effects so read the setting tooltip).  Method Raid Tools now has a standard LibDBIcon (though it's based on the original, custom icon).  If you come across any addons that aren't given a standard icon, please let me know.

2.5.79 - 18th December 2021
- If 'Combine addon buttons' ('Enhance minimap)' is enabled, addon button tooltips will now be shown under the minimap so as not to clutter the button frame.  This should work with most addon buttons.  Fixed a potential issue with addons using non-standard buttons that may have been caused Leatrix Plus not to load correctly.

2.5.78 - 17th December 2021
- Fixed a situational issue with 'Replace non-standard buttons' for 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') creating unintended minimap buttons.

2.5.75 - 16th December 2021
- Added a new option 'Filter chat messages' ('Chat').  If enabled, you can block spell links in combat (useful for blocking spell interrupt spam), drunken spam (if it doesn't apply to your character) and duel victory and retreat spam (if you didn't take part in the duel).
- Added a new slider setting to 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') called 'Square size' which allows you to adjust the square minimap size (up to 400%).  While the scale slider makes the minimap and all the elements bigger, the size slider makes the minimap bigger but keeps all the elements the same size.  If you are using the square minimap, you can use either the scale slider or the size slider or a combination of the two.  The configuration panel reset button will not reset settings that require a UI reload.  Added a new setting called 'Replace non-standard buttons'.  Most addons use the standard LibDBIcon library for their minimap buttons but a few addons use non-standard buttons instead.  The new setting will replace any non-standard buttons with LibDBIcon buttons.  This will solve the problems with non-standard buttons such as not hiding automatically, not following the minimap shape and not being placed in the button frame.  Added a new setting called 'Exclude BugSack' which will keep the BugSack addon minimap button visible if you have BugSack installed and the minimap button enabled.
- Updated the tooltips for 'Manage frames' and 'Manage focus' ('Frames').

2.5.74 - 9th December 2021
- Fixed a few default UI minimap button locations for 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface') when using the square minimap.

2.5.73 - 8th December 2021
- Added some new settings to 'Enhance minimap' ('Interface').  'Square minimap' changes the minimap shape to a square.  'Hide addon buttons' hides addon buttons automatically while the pointer is not over the minimap.  'Combine addon buttons' combines all addon buttons into a single frame which you can toggle by right-clicking the minimap (cannot be used with 'Hide addon buttons').  You can always drag the minimap now while holding the alt key so the 'Unlock map frame' setting has been removed.  The maximum minimap scale is now 400% (was 200%).
- If 'Automate gossip' ('Automation') is enabled, battlemaster gossip will now be automatically selected and the battleground name will be shown at the top of the battlefield instance window.
- Fixed a minor issue with 'Enhance professions' ('Interface') which caused the craft frame filter dropdown menu to not be positioned correctly.  Also fixed a minor issue with the default UI which caused beast training points to show in profession frames (this bug is not caused by addons).

2.5.72 - 2nd December 2021
- If 'Enhance minimap' is enabled, you can toggle the zone text bar once again using a setting in the configuration panel.  Added a new setting to toggle the world map button.

2.5.71 - 2nd December 2021
- To address issues with minimap cluster scaling (which have been present for a long time), the 'Scale entire cluster' setting has been removed.  Also fixed a minor issue causing the minimap toggle button to be visible.

2.5.70 - 1st December 2021
- The 'Enhance minimap' option ('Interface') has two new settings.  The first is 'Unlock minimap'.  If enabled, you can hold alt and drag the minimap to move it.  The second is 'Scale entire cluster'.  If checked, the scale slider will apply to the entire minimap cluster.  If unchecked, the scale slider will only apply to the minimap.  The zone text bar is now always hidden.
- The 'Show Wowhead links' option ('Interface') now has a configuration panel allowing you to choose whether links should go directly to the comments section.
- The 'Recent chat window' option ('Chat') will now use the same font and size as the chat window.  Fixed an issue which sometimes caused the recent chat window font size to be smaller than intended.
- Fixed a minor issue with 'Automate quests' ('Automation') which caused Mark of Sargeras and Sunfury Signet reputation turn-ins to not be automated if you only had one of either item in your bags.

2.5.68 - 17th November 2021
- Added an animation slider setting to 'Enhance dressup' ('Interface').
- Added a configuration panel for 'Accept resurrection' ('Automation') so you can choose whether combat resurrection should be excluded.
- Added a 'Guild' setting to the 'Social' page which allows you to choose whether the 'Social' page options should apply to guild members or not (previously, 'Social' page options always applied to guild members).
- Added 'Yawns' to 'Mute game sounds' ('System').  If checked, yawns from hunter pet cats will be muted.

2.5.67 - 10th November 2021
- Added a new setting to 'Enhance dressup' ('Interface') which adds item buttons to the dressing room.  Added a 'Show me' button and a button to toggle the new item buttons.  The 'Remove tabard' button is now part of the new item buttons.
- Added a new option 'Hide action button text' ('Text').  If enabled, macro and keybind text will not be shown on action buttons.

2.5.66 - 4th November 2021
- Added a new option 'More font sizes' ('Chat').  If enabled, additional font sizes will be available in the chat frame font size menu.
