Group Bulletin Board

GBB provides an overview of the endless requests in the chat channels. It detects all requests to the classic dungeons, sorts them and presents them clearly way. Numerous filtering options reduce the gigantic number to exactly the dungeons that interest you. And if that's not enough, GBB will let you know about any new request via a sound or chat notification. And finally, GBB can post your request repeatedly.
Currently, English, German and Russian dungeons are recognized natively. But it is easily possible to adapt GBB to any language.

Usage
GBB searches the chat messages for dungeon requests in the background. To whisper a person, simply click on the entry with the left mouse button. For a "/who" a shift + left click is enough. The dungeon list can be filtered in the settings. You can also fold this by left-clicking on the dungeon name.
Old entries are filtered out after 150 seconds.
