# This Addon implements a means to filter the spells in SpellBookFrame.
# The only filter so far is a Rank Filter that skips all ranks except 
# for the last rank, which should be the highest rank available.
#
# To relocate the Rank Filter Button or Auto UpRank Button, hold CTRL+ Right Click, drag to new location, and then release buttons
#
# Slash Commands:
#	"/sba" resets the Option Buttons' locations (will change if more functions are added)
#
# Additional functionalty is being developed for making it easier to identify spells that require specific forms.
