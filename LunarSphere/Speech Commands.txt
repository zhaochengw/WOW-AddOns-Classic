I. Intro
============================================================

LunarSphere has a speech system that allows the user to have
their character say text in the SAY, GROUP, RAID, EMOTE, or
WHISPER channels when a spell or item is used. This feature
also allows the use of special keywords or commands to help
personalize the text that is spit out. One such example
could be:

===========================================
I'm going to heal <target> with <spell>!
===========================================

Which would replace <target> with the name of your current
target, and <spell> with the spell or item that was used to
trigger the speech. There are quite a few speech commands,
so this file will help you.

III. Details for each command
============================================================

Here are the details:

<emote>
	Forces the text after this command to be an emote
	and spoken to the emote channel.

<focus>
	The focus target's name will replace this command,
	so you can say the name of your focus. An example
	could be:

	"I'm getting ready to sheep <focus>!"

	Result:
	
	Moongaze says: I'm getting ready to sheep Arthas!

<mount>
	The name of the mount being summoned will replace
	this command. This is useful for mount speeches.
	An example could be:

	"I'm mounting my <mount>!"

	Result:

	Moongaze says: I'm mounting my Black Kodo!

<newline>
	Forces the speech to be split into another line.
	This is useful for multi-part speeches. An example
	could be:

	"Why do I need to summon them?<newline><emote>cries.

	Result:
	
	Moongaze says: Why do I need to summon them?
	Moongaze cries.

<party>
	Forces the text after this command to be a party
	speech and spoken to the party channel.
	
<pet>
	The hunter or warlock's pet name will replace this
	command, so you can say the name of your pet. This
	typically only works when the pet is already out,
	sorry =(. An example could be:

	"Come here, <pet>! You get to eat fish!"

	Result:
	
	Moongaze says: Come here, Luna! You get to eat fish!

<player>
	The name of the player will replace this command,
	so you can say your name, for whatever reason.
	An example could be:

	"<target>, I'm <player>, your killer!"

	Result:
	
	Moongaze says: Arthas, I'm Moongaze, your killer!

<portal>
	The name of the portal being opened replace this
	command, so you can say where you are porting to.
	An example could be:

	"Opening a portal to <portal>! Hop in!"
	
	Result:

	Moongaze says: Opening a portal to Dalaran! Hop in!

<raid>
	Forces the text after this command to be a raid
	speech and spoken to the raid channel.

<say>
	Forces the text after this command to be a say
	speech and spoken to the say channel.

<sound=PATH\SOUND.WAV>
	This is a special command that plays a sound file
	in the World of Warcraft folder. This is useful for
	playing NPC speech sound effects, explosion sounds,
	or whatever else you want, when you cast a spell or
	use an item. Remember, only YOU can hear this sound.
	The PATH must be the location the sound file can be
	found, from the WOW folder. The SOUND.WAV is the
	sound file you wish to play, followed by .wav. An
	example could be:

	"Get over here!<sound=Sound\Creature\HeadlessHorseman\Horseman_Beckon_01.wav>"

	Result:

	Moongaze: Get over here!
	(sound file with headless horseman saying: "Get over here you idiot!")

<spell>
	The name of the spell or item being used to trigger
	the speech will replace this command, so you can say
	what you are using. An example could be:
	
	"<spell> for all!"

	Result:

	Moongaze says: Prayer of Fortitude for all!

<target>
	The target's name will replace this command, so
	you can say the name of your target. An example
	could be:

	"Chaining <target>! You break it, you tank it!"

	Result:
	
	Moongaze says: Chaining Zombie! You break it, you tank it!"

<whisper>
	Forces the text after this command to be a whisper
	and spoken to the whisper channel to your target.
	
<yell>
	Forces the text after this command to be a yell
	and spoken to the yell channel.
