- Pass on SoB bosses to update timers and alerts to modern M+ data  
    pass on ALL trash mods for entirety of game to allow warnings during combat as standard in dungeons in TWW since profile has deemed it a not a worthwhile performance saving and in most cases only acted as detrimate to players if they pulled trash with boss. (translation, trash warnings are now always permited during boss fights in dungeons)  
- Full Siege of Boralus trash update with  
     - all missing spells I could find on resources like Quazzi's spreadsheet  
     - As many nameplate CDs as I could possibly add for all these spells from the data available  
     - Scoped trash/boss versions of some spells to avoid duplicate alerts  
     - Moved some triggers to combat log
