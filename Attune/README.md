by Cixi@Remulos (Classic Oceanic)


WHAT THE ADDON IS FOR:
  Attune is there to collect your current attunement progress, and character information (class/race/etc) and allow you to upload that information to the WarcraftRatings website
  The Website will then allow you to display/edit/share your attunement progress with others/guildies
  The uploaded profiles can be found at https://warcraftratings.com/attune


INSTALLATION:
  - Copy the "Attune" folder into your Wow Classic \Interface\AddOns\ folder
  - Restart World of Warcraft Classic
 
  
HOW TO ACTIVATE:
  Just type '/attune' in chat to display your progress. 
  If you want to share this progress with the community, click the "export" button. 
  This will open a window with an encoded string you can copy to your clipboard
  The data can then be uploaded at https://warcraftratings.com/attune/upload for sharing/updating/etc

  To survey the progress of your guild, click the "survey" button to collect the information.
	You will then receive progress data from any guild member with the addon.
