# What's Training?
What's Training? is an addon for World of Warcraft Classic that adds a list of available trainer spells to the spell book, so you can easily know when to seek a class trainer out.  Spells you already know won't show up.

## Class Trainer Plus support
If you have [Class Trainer Plus](https://github.com/fusionpit/ClassTrainerPlus) installed, What's Training will show Ignored spells at the bottom.

## Known Issues
 - Rogue Poisons not working well, it will show available even if you don't have the required skill level in poisons
 - Additional ranks for talents may or may not work, I have no idea at this point.
