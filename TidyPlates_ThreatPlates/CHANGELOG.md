# 11.0.6 (2022-11-04)

* Fixed a bug with custom styles for nameplates where the nameplate style wasn't correctly reset after a trigger was no longer active (e.g., after the aura triggering the style expired).
* Upgrade integrated libraries (LibSharedMedia v10.0.0, LibCustomGlow 1.0.3-4-g357b944) [Comment #6591].
