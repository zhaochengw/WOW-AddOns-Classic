# Description

View all your artifacts progress, and solve them in one compact frame.
Also you can view all your artifact history neatly sorted by race, and a list of dig sites.
You can left-click the keystone button to attach keystones (or right-click to remove),
or if you prefer there are options to automatically use keystones!
You can monitor the artifacts progress, or how close you are to the fragment cap.
