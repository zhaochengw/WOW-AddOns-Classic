Normally the Main Tank and the Main Assist roles have been used to identify Main Tanks and Off-Tanks (Main Assist) however, some guilds assign the Main Tank role to both Main Tanks and Off-Tanks and assign the Main Assist role to Healers. 

By having a separate setting for both roles it will allow Paladin Class Leaders or Raid Leaders to remove, as an example, Greater Blessing of Salvation from Tanking classes or if Druid or Paladin Healers are marked with the Main Assist role they could be setup to get Normal Blessing of Wisdom vs Greater Blessing of Might which would allow assigning Greater Blessing of Might for DPS spec'd Druids and Paladins and Normal Blessing of Wisdom to Healing spec'd Druids and Paladins.
