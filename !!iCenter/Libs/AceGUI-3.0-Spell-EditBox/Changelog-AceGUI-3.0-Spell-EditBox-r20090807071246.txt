Shadowed:
	- Redid everything to be a bit more flexible, fixed professions spells showing added new dialog types:
	- Spell_EditBox = Dump of every spell in the list without special filtering
	- Aura_EditBox = Auras (Has a description, range is within 100 yards)
	- Cast_EditBox = Casts (Has a cast time)
	- Player_Editbox = Player spells only
	- - Updated file list
	- - TOC Bump
	- * Added Ace3 as an optional dependency so it won't error depending on load order
	- * I spell gud
	- * Added the ability to use the arrow keys to browse through the predicted spell list
	* Upped the prediction list to 10 rows (was 8)
	* Upped the delay to 500 spells per 0.10 second but made the time elapsed run every 0.10 seconds without time loss, and update the prediction frame every 1 second while scanning
	- * Initial Import: Let's see if this works
