An addon to help you find appropriate food for your hunter pet that is not used for quests or cooking.

The addon will place a button together with the happiness indicator. The button indicates which food is to be served, and feed it to the pet when you press the button.

The addon also provides an options page where you can select which foods you want to use.

The original addon was made by Gazmik Fizzwidget, but it was abandoned and published as open-source on GitHub. This is a fork that adds support for WoW classic.
