# Already Known?

## [1.73](https://github.com/ahakola/AlreadyKnown/tree/1.73) (2024-05-30)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/ahakola/AlreadyKnown/compare/1.72...1.73) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/ahakola/AlreadyKnown/releases)

- Trying to add some kind of support for Warlock Grimoires in Classic variations of the game  
    - This should match all the grimoires for already known pet spells for you current pet.  
    - Data about known grimoires isn't saved between logins/UI reloads, but the previously marked as known grimoires are cached even if you swap your demon and visit grimoires vendor again.  
    - I'm not going to enable saving the data between sessions, so don't even ask for it. Idea of the addon for me has been trying to minimize the amount of data hard coded and have zero saved data about known items.  
    - This should close CF issue #21  
    - Might improve this feature later, but don't expect anything to happen anytime soon!
