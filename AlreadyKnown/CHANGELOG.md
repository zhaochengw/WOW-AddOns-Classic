# Already Known?

## [1.75](https://github.com/ahakola/AlreadyKnown/tree/1.75) (2024-09-07)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/ahakola/AlreadyKnown/compare/1.74...1.75) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/ahakola/AlreadyKnown/releases)

- Improve "/ak itemtest"  
    - Add classId and subclassId for the tested item if found.  
- I thought we didn't need this block of code after WrathClassic, but apparently some companion pets won't be marked properly in CataClassic without it  
    - This should close GH issue #13
